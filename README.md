# How safe is your obfuscation?

This project explores the level of obfuscation that deep learning models can bypass. We use the state-of-the-art Insightface
and compare that with our own model named SlayNet.

LFW dataset taken from Kaggle (first hit when you search for it)

Put together by:
- Gabriel Hishida
